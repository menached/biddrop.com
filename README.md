# BidDrop

## Overview
BidDrop is a web application designed to bridge the gap between general contractors and subcontractors. The platform enables contractors to post projects and subcontractors to monitor, bid, and compete for those projects. With a focus on transparency and ease of use, BidDrop empowers subcontractors—who will outnumber contractors—to find work opportunities and help contractors complete projects efficiently.

This GitHub repository ([https://github.com/biddrop.com](https://github.com/biddrop.com)) serves as a collaborative space for developers, clients, and other stakeholders to contribute feedback, track progress, and continuously improve the application.

## Purpose
The primary goal of BidDrop is to streamline the process of matching contractors with skilled subcontractors. By providing a dedicated platform for project posting, bidding, and communication, the app aims to enhance efficiency and foster a competitive environment that benefits both parties.

## Features
- **User Management:**  
  - **Contractors:** Create profiles, post projects, review bids, and select subcontractors.  
  - **Subcontractors:** Create profiles, search for projects, submit bids, and communicate with contractors.

- **Project Posting and Bidding:**  
  - Contractors can post detailed project requirements including timelines, budgets, and necessary qualifications.  
  - Subcontractors can browse available projects, filter by category or location, and place competitive bids.

- **Notifications:**  
  - Automated email and/or SMS notifications inform users about new postings, bid statuses, and important project updates.

- **File Management:**  
  - Integration with AWS S3 and EFS for secure and scalable storage of project documents, images, and other relevant files.

- **Serverless Processing:**  
  - Utilization of AWS Lambda functions (using Python) to handle asynchronous tasks such as bid processing, notifications, and data analytics.

- **Feedback and Collaboration:**  
  - The GitHub repo is used for tracking issues, feature requests, and ongoing improvements. This allows both developers and clients to provide continuous input into the project.

## Subcontractor Categories

- **Electrical Contractors:** Specialists in wiring, lighting, and electrical installations.
- **Plumbing Contractors:** Experts in piping systems, drainage, and water supply installations.
- **HVAC Specialists:** Professionals in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.
- **Carpenters:** Skilled in woodworking, framing, cabinetry, and finish carpentry.
- **Roofing Contractors:** Specialists in roof installation, repair, and maintenance.
- **Masonry Contractors:** Experts in brick, stone, and concrete work.
- **Painting and Finishing Contractors:** Professionals for both interior and exterior painting, as well as finishing work.

## Architecture and Technology Stack
BidDrop is built to be robust, scalable, and secure. Below is an outline of the core technologies used:

- **LAMP Stack:**  
  - **Linux:** The operating system for the server environment.
  - **Apache:** The web server handling HTTP requests.
  - **MySQL:** The relational database system storing user profiles, projects, bids, and transaction data.
  - **PHP:** The server-side scripting language managing business logic and interactions between the front end and database.

- **AWS Integration:**  
  - **S3/EFS:** For secure, scalable file storage, handling project documents, images, and other media.
  - **AWS Lambda (Python):** Serverless functions to manage asynchronous tasks such as notifications, data processing, and bid evaluations.

- **Client-side Technologies:**  
  - Modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript frameworks to deliver a responsive and intuitive user interface.

## Functionality Flow
1. **User Registration and Authentication:**  
   - Contractors and subcontractors register via an intuitive sign-up process.
   - Secure login and role-specific dashboards guide users to their respective functionalities.

2. **Project Posting:**  
   - Contractors post detailed project requirements, attach relevant documentation, and specify which subcontractor categories are required.
   - Projects include key details such as deadlines, budgets, and necessary qualifications.

3. **Browsing and Bidding:**  
   - Subcontractors browse projects using filters like location, category, and project type.
   - The bidding system allows subcontractors to submit proposals with cost estimates, timelines, and additional relevant information.

4. **Review and Awarding:**  
   - Contractors review bids through an organized dashboard, comparing offers based on price, experience, and bid quality.
   - Once a bid is awarded, both parties receive confirmation and next steps via notifications.

5. **Communication and Feedback:**  
   - An integrated messaging system enables real-time communication between contractors and subcontractors.
   - The platform supports ongoing feedback and rating systems to enhance future interactions.

6. **Developer and Client Collaboration:**
